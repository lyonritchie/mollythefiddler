Donegal fiddling is characterized by short, driven bow strokes, the use of double stops and octave playing, and by its generally swift tempo. It has similarities to Cape-Breton fiddling and strong ties to traditional Scottish music.There are many types of tunes played in Donegal, and some (such as barn dances, highlands and mazurkas) further distinguish the music from southern styles of playing.

Molly says, "I love the spirited approach, technical challenges and variety found in Donegal fiddling. It is a wonderful style to play for dancing and listening. I have picked up some variations during my years in Pittsburgh but stay fairly close to my primary influence.The tradition is lively and compelling."

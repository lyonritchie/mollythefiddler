It has similarities to Cape-Breton fiddling and strong ties to traditional Scottish music. There are many types of tunes played in Donegal, and some (such as barn dances, highlands and mazurkas) further distinguish the region's music from southern styles of playing.

  <p>I love the spirited approach, technical challenges and variety found in Donegal fiddling. It is a wonderful style to play for dancing and listening. I have picked up some variations over the years but stay fairly close to my primary influence. The tradition is lively and compelling.</p>

Cultural events, festivals, galleries, weddings, birthdays and gatherings of all kinds can be excellent occasions for live, traditional Irish music. Molly loves playing for dancers, schoolchildren and nursing home patients.

When inquiring about booking, provide information about the occasion, time and date, event space, anticipated crowd size and budget. This will help determine how many musicians are appropriate and if there is any need for amplification.
